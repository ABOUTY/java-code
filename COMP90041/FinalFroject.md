# Final Project: Disaster Relief Robots 

## Introduction 

You are a software developer at RescueBots Inc., a robotics company that develops technology to
aid in life-threatening situations. The company has recently built a fleet of autonomous robots that
can assist in rescue operations during natural disasters, such as bushfires and floods. RescueBots'
robots can navigate unknown terrain and successfully locate and rescue people in need of help. For
these robots to be truly autonomous and effective, however, they must be capable of making difficult 
decisions. The RescueBots robots must be programmed to prioritize and determine the order of
rescue operations, a feat with ethical and moral implications.
In this project, you will create the decision engine for RescueBots, i.e., a program designed to explore
different scenarios and make critical decisions about whom to save. You will finally audit your
decision-making algorithm through simulations, and allow users of your program to judge the
outcomes themselves.
